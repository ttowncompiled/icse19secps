def run_trial(alpha, beta, n, uavs, victims, adj):
    """
        Executes a single trial of the experiment with the provided parameters

        INPUT:
            alpha - The probability that the UAV's sensors detect a single victim in the same zone,
            beta - The probability that a victim remains in their current zone for the next turn,
            n - The number of zones in the city,
            uavs - A list of integers representing the zones of the UAVs initial deployment
                configuration,
            victims - A list of integers representing the zones of the victims initial deployment
                configuration, and
            adj - A dictionary which takes a zone i and returns the zones adjacent to i.
        OUTPUT:
            A tuple containing the two best branches from the game tree - the first excludes
                collisions while the second includes collisions - both are formatted as a list of
                tuples where each is a tuple of integers representing the zones of each UAV.
